The People Who Record Beauty

To Eun-ha,
It's been a long time since I've told you my feelings in such a long story.

You always held my hand, so I thought our hands, clasped without even the smallest gap, were enough to convey my heart.

But today, I want to tell you a deeper story. Please listen to all of it, even if it's a bit long.

You know that I am a person who likes to record and talk about beauty.

Eun-ha, you must remember that summer day three years ago.

The moment I came to deny my daily life that I had taken for granted.
That day, Woo-jin was walking to a meeting with a publishing company.

Since this new work was a fairy tale set overseas, I had referenced a lot of materials.

Carrying a load full of countless materials, Woo-jin did not see a brick in front of him, which was slightly crooked and became a rather large obstacle, and tripped over it.

But the middle of Seoul during the morning rush hour is literally a battlefield. Every second is precious to everyone, and there is no time to look away at others.

I know that if you show goodwill to someone who seems to need help in such a situation, you will receive the 'Brave Citizen Award,' but what is the use of all that?

Because modern society is one where you fall behind if you are even one step slower than others, there is no room for the luxury of doing good deeds.

Woo-jin knows that fact all too well. Because he is also a citizen of this city. At first, falling down in the middle of the road was extremely embarrassing.

But knowing that people, busy with their own lives, would not look at him for more than three seconds, he naturally picked up his belongings.

Collecting them carefully, one sheet at a time. His knee, which had hit hard when he fell, ached terribly, but because he would obviously be nagged by the person in charge if he was late for the meeting with the publishing company, he decided to forget the pain for a moment.

But then, a feeling of someone grabbing his shoulder, along with an excited voice.

"Excuse me! Do you know you're bleeding a lot right now...? From what I see, you should go to the emergency room right away for treatment!"

It felt like scenes were being imprinted in his head, second by second. The hand that gently grabbed his shoulder so he wouldn't be surprised, despite having rushed over quickly out of worry for Woo-jin.

But unlike that hand, her voice was urgent, quickly conveying the situation.

A drop of sweat that fell from Woo-jin's forehead and stained the back of his hand, due to the scorching heat and dazzling sunlight.

The honking of angry cars on the rush hour commute that is blocked every single day, and mixing with that, the sound of her catching her breath.

Because all those sensations rushed in at once, Woo-jin was speechless for a moment.

"I'm sorry if you were too surprised. But I was more surprised. Because you were bleeding in the middle of the road... All these things scattered around here are your belongings, right? I'll gather them and call an ambulance for you, so please just sit on this bench and wait for a moment."

Only then could Woo-jin collect himself. The emergency room. His pain, which felt like it should be insignificant among the busy people, and his own attempt to simply ignore it, made him feel a little embarrassed.

"...Thank you for your concern. But aren't you in a busy situation? I think you're on your way to work right now."

Since it was morning and he could hear footsteps much faster than on the way home from work, Woo-jin's heart sped up to match that pace.

He was worried that he might be late, but more than that, he was concerned about a complete stranger's commute to work.

He just wanted to fulfill his role as a member of society, he didn't want to become a person who causes trouble like this.

"It's okay, I still have plenty of time. I came out a little early because the weather looked refreshing today. And then I ran into this situation. Oh, you must be hurting. Just wait a little while. The ambulance will be here soon."

It is rare for someone to even take care of the refreshing morning air. A person's desire is to sleep for ten more minutes before going to work.

This was the first time he had met someone who helped him, and the first time he had met someone who gave up morning sleep to experience good weather.

As doubt began to creep up in his heart because she seemed like an unusual person in many ways, he was relieved when he heard the sound of the ambulance.

She gently supported Woo-jin and went to where the paramedics were, and Woo-jin was able to safely get into the ambulance.
"Go carefully. I hope you get your injury treated well."

"...Yes. Thank you for caring so much. I hope you have a good commute to work."
And so I rode away in the ambulance, and of course, I couldn't make it to the meeting.

After receiving treatment well, I was again living my own busy daily life.

The moment I took off the last bandage after the injury on my knee had healed, Eun-ha came to mind.

Thinking, what if Eun-ha hadn't done that good deed for me then? I would have gone to the meeting place bleeding profusely.

Of course, I thought of Eun-ha several times even before that. When I was walking somewhere early in the morning, I had a feeling that Eun-ha might be sharing this fresh morning with me.

I think a few weeks passed like that. Then, the first smell I noticed when I woke up in the morning was no longer the smell of my sweat from fighting the heat all night, but the smell of the cold autumn wind.

Especially on that day, the morning sunlight was like human warmth, and the cool air greatly enhanced the atmosphere of the scenery.

I suddenly wanted to share this moment with someone. Knowing that loneliness quickly drives a person to ruin, whenever I felt alone, I sharpened all my senses to feel all the beings in this world and consoled myself.

For some reason, that consolation made me feel particularly lonely that day.
It was only a brief encounter, but unable to forget the intense sensations of that moment, I went back to that place.

Wearing a soft cardigan suitable for the autumn atmosphere, and bringing a recorder so as not to miss the moments of the beautiful autumn scenery.

And one more special thing I brought was the expectation that I might accidentally run into Eun-ha.

Romance does not exist in reality, but what I draw as I please is what unfolds endlessly as romance.
I sat on the bench and felt the autumn.

The rustling sound of dried leaves falling, the cold feeling mixed in the air entering my nose, but the still warm sunlight, and then, what concentrated all my senses,
"We meet again here, Author of fairy tales."

Woo-jin came to believe that romance definitely exists. Woo-jin recognized Eun-ha as soon as he heard her voice and felt as if he had returned to that summer day for a moment.

"I'm sorry if I surprised you. I seem to surprise you every time. Ah, actually, I knew you were the author of a fairy tale I like after seeing the materials you dropped that time. I'm an elementary school teacher, so I read a lot of fairy tales."

"...Ah, thank you. No, not thank you... How did you get here..."
"Today is the weekend, but strangely my eyes opened early. Maybe it was because it was slightly colder than usual. When I opened the window, autumn had arrived without me knowing. So I came right out. To greet autumn."

Just by coming out with the same thought as me, I felt like we were sharing my world. My world, which I had only released into the space of fairy tales.

It might be because she liked the fairy tale I wrote, but I just wanted to misunderstand it however I pleased.

That I could finally talk to someone else about how I feel the world, day by day.

That day we sat on the bench and talked for a long time, and although we didn't make a promise, we met every morning to feel the autumn together.

When Eun-ha overslept and was running late for work, we only exchanged brief greetings, and on holidays, we chatted about trivial things until lunchtime and then ate together.

The season when Christmas carols flow through the streets was approaching. For about two months, we shared the world as each of us saw it, and because of that, I felt like my world had expanded infinitely.

I could tell that Eun-ha was fully accepting my story as it was, through her slightly high but calm voice, her gestures and body movements that showed she was listening to me, and the flow of this air we shared, and it was the same for me.

But I always worried. Because my world is different from others, I didn't know how Eun-ha was feeling.

If you remember that summer day three years ago, you probably remember that winter day of the same year too. It was the day two worlds became one world.

Every day, Woo-jin waited for Eun-ha on the same bench. With the weather becoming quite harsh, Woo-jin thoroughly prepared by putting on a thick jumper, hot packs in both side pockets, and gloves before going outside.

As soon as he stepped out the door, he felt cold pieces of air being absorbed into his body, and after a few steps, Woo-jin quickly adapted to the temperature.

Contrary to the chilly air felt on his skin, Woo-jin felt strangely good due to the warm energy spreading from the hot packs around his waist.

Because warmth coexisted in this winter where only coldness should exist. Woo-jin headed for that bench, harboring the expectation that his heart would also soon warm up when he met Eun-ha.

I just thought Eun-ha had overslept. So I figured she would only say hello and leave today.

But gradually, the sound of people's footsteps decreased, and I knew that rush hour was over, but Eun-ha didn't come.

Whether she had an accident on the way, or if she stayed up all night preparing for class and still hadn't woken up. All sorts of thoughts came to mind, but I just sat there.

There was nothing I could do, but I believed that if I waited, Eun-ha would definitely come.

And sitting quietly and feeling the air, I felt like I could soon hear the sound of true winter arriving.

I felt that if I listened to that sound with Eun-ha, I could once again feel a warmth like a person's embrace even in that cold.

Just as the hot pack was starting to cool, I heard the sound of someone running in dress shoes from far away.
"...Woo-jin!"

"Ah, Eun-ha! Are you hurt anywhere? Nothing happened-"
"Woo-jin, I'm fine. No, first of all, I'm really sorry. I woke up too late today and didn't have time to stop by for you. Just in case, I thought maybe you'd be waiting for me, so I ran here as soon as class was over. What should I do about being so sorry..."

Eun-ha spoke to me in a flustered, uneasy voice, not knowing what to do.

Saying that, while wrapping the scarf she had been wearing around me. I could feel her sincere heart conveyed through the warmth of Eun-ha that remained on the scarf.

"I'm relieved that nothing happened to you, Eun-ha. If you're really sorry, would you sit next to me?"

"Of course. What should we talk about today? How to greet winter? Your favorite winter snack?"
"Today, let's not talk for a moment."

"Why? Woo-jin, you're actually angry right now, aren't you?"
"Haha, no. There's something I want to do with you right now. It's one of my favorite things."

"Wow, it's an honor for me to do that with you. What is it?"
"Closing our eyes and listening to the sound of winter arriving."

Eun-ha closed her eyes and listened to the sound for a few seconds.
"Hmm, I don't quite get what it is yet."

"You'll know if you listen. Ah, you'll hear it soon. Shh-"
And so, Woo-jin and Eun-ha were silent for a few minutes for the first time.

There was only the feeling of being together in one space, the cold air of winter, and the sound of winter arriving.
"Eun-ha, can you hear it?"

"...No. I listened hard, but I don't really know what the sound of winter arriving is. All I hear are the occasional passing cars, people's footsteps, and the sound of the winter wind."

"I couldn't hear it well at first either. But once you hear it, you start waiting for this sound from early winter. Now, hold out your hand first."

Eun-ha held out her hand with a question. Placing his palm against the back of the hand Eun-ha held out, they gently extended their hands forward together.

Soon after, a few snowflakes landed on Eun-ha's palm, melting softly and remaining on Eun-ha's hand.
"Eun-ha, what did you just feel?"

Eun-ha smiled slightly and answered.
"Snowflakes landed on my hand. It was a little cold."

"That's right. Snow came to your hand, Eun-ha. The moment it touched your hand, the snow melted. But it doesn't disappear. It melted into water, so its outward appearance has completely changed, but it is still the same thing. It just briefly changed its form to become a friend similar to us. Of course, that process must be difficult from the snow's perspective. That's why, when it goes to friends who are exactly the same temperature and form as itself, it greets them, saying 'hello.' I can hear that sound everywhere today."

Woo-jin naturally took Eun-ha's palm, which was touching his hand. Their warmth was shared between their clasped hands.

Eun-ha completely closed her eyes to concentrate more while listening to Woo-jin's story. Then, as if she suddenly realized something, Eun-ha opened her eyes wide.

And then with a surprised voice,
"Woo-jin, I think I heard it, the sound of winter arriving."
"Yes, what did it sound like?"

"The snowflakes... slowly come down from the sky. Then, when they arrive where there are beings they can rely on together, that's when they say hello. With a 'sa-bak-' sound."

Eun-ha, who answered, let out a slight laugh, and smiled happily like a child seeing snow for the first time in their life.

"Thank you for letting me hear this sound, Woo-jin. When I meet you, my world expands more beautifully."

Woo-jin, who heard Eun-ha's words, wore a faint smile and naturally squeezed Eun-ha's hand, which he had been holding, a little tighter.

"Eun-ha, there are so many beautiful fragments of the world I want to introduce to you, like today. They are things I've felt with all my senses through the way I've looked at the world until now. But Eun-ha, you can see the beautiful world directly with your eyes. I will tell you about my world, and in return, will you tell me about the world as seen through your eyes from now on?"

Eun-ha, who heard those words, smiled brightly and answered Woo-jin. Then, inhaling the cold air, she hugged Woo-jin tightly.

That night, when heavy snow fell, one could see a couple slowly taking a walk, holding hands tightly.

That's how Eun-ha entered my world and began to see the world from the same perspective. Until then, all the beautiful parts of the world I had seen were expressed in fairy tales.

Readers are surprised, asking how I have such creativity, but in fact, it was just me writing out exactly what I felt.

The scent of cherry blossoms scattering like rain, the stories that insects whispered to me on a summer dawn, the inscrutable nature of soft but aloof fallen leaves, and the cozy feeling that can be felt even in the cold winter.

Even just giving simple examples by season, there are so many. Eun-ha must have found the fragments I told her about during the time we spent together, right?

Eun-ha, who always tells me 'thank you,' said that because of me, she learned that the world is beautiful.

Saying that if I hadn't been by her side, she would have lived her whole life with the same perspective every day and wouldn't have been able to fill her life with those precious sights.

But I am filling my world more just with Eun-ha's existence. The feeling of sharing my life with someone is warmer than being under a blanket before sleep, and the emotion of love that exists between Eun-ha and me makes me happier than the welcoming feeling towards the shyly blooming roadside flowers in early spring.

The warm look in Eun-ha's eyes as she looks at me, making eye contact, the lovely smile she must be wearing when talking to me, and that hand always extended towards me without change.

Even though I cannot see all of this, I can feel it. In the space where I am with Eun-ha, love is floating around in droplets, I feel warmth because we are touching, and I could read Eun-ha's heart through her soft breathing.

But it would be a lie if I said I didn't get greedy sometimes. What the blue color of the sea that Eun-ha talks about is, what the night sky full of stars that look like they're about to pour down looks like, why you know autumn is coming when you see the trees.

I also thought the world was beautiful enough, but I know that the world Eun-ha sees with her eyes is also very beautiful.

If I could also see that scenery with her, how happy would Eun-ha be?

We would be able to share more emotions and have deeper conversations about the world.

Just sharing time while clearly looking at the same place would be happiness. And we could talk about love while looking into each other's eyes.

There are countless ways to express love. You can convey your heart by hugging each other, or you can give a gift that makes the other person smile.

But a look in the eyes holds so much. I've never seen it, but I can feel it.

I really want to give Eun-ha the beautiful and warm gaze that I have always received one-sidedly.

But soon, I will be able to make Eun-ha even happier. Actually, this is the reason I wrote this letter.

Knowing that Eun-ha is the person who will be happiest to hear this fact, I am telling you first.

Being able to look at the world in a new way makes me so excited. But truthfully, I am also very afraid at the same time.

Because I feel like I won't be able to feel the world like before anymore. Knowing that Eun-ha deeply loves my ability to discover the beauty of the world that others easily miss, I feel like Eun-ha will leave if that aspect of me disappears.

What if my world changes too much and my center is shaken, Eun-ha?

However, I am blocking the uneasy feelings that come in like waves as they please, with the strong sandcastle that Eun-ha built in my heart.

Of course, sometimes a very strong wave hit, but I was able to rebuild the collapsed parts. Because the sand is constantly being filled with the love Eun-ha gives me.

A sandcastle of this size seems like it can protect my heart.
After talking about my heart for a long time, I feel like I can accept the future that is approaching me as it is.

And I also gain the certainty that I will discover other beauties in that world. Eun-ha, thank you for giving me courage, love, and another reason to live life.

Thanks to you, I was able to come this far.
I am now going to face a new world. I hope this letter reaches Eun-ha soon.

See you soon.
Sent by Woo-jin, who is going to meet the new beauty of the world.
Woo-jin pressed the stop button on the recorder, as if he had finished everything he wanted to say.

He put the tape on which the letter was recorded into his pocket, called a taxi, and headed to the hospital. His face looked nervous, but he occasionally smiled and fidgeted with his fingers, as if thinking happy thoughts.

Woo-jin got out of the taxi and walked confidently toward the hospital.
"You are Mr. Kang Woo-jin, who reserved surgery today, correct? Please wait in your seat for a moment, and we will guide you."

Woo-jin sat down and closed his eyes, thinking about various things. Perhaps, about Eun-ha. After some time passed, the nurse stood up and called Woo-jin.

"Mr. Kang Woo-jin, we will go in for the cornea transplant surgery. This way, please."

-Epilogue-

To Woo-jin,
Woo-jin, I listened to the letter well. I liked the feeling of reciting our memories together.

Woo-jin, there is absolutely no need to be anxious. When you successfully finish the surgery and come out, you will simply have come to know a world much wider than others already.

You might temporarily forget what you used to feel. But every time that happens, let's hold hands, close our eyes, and find the hidden beautiful fragments of the world again.

There are so many things I want to do with you, Woo-jin. The very first thing I want to do is watch the sunset over the sea together.

I want to be moved by seeing the color of the sky change moment by moment, and I want to talk while looking at the same scenery. I want to feel our love, which will be as hot as the setting sun.

And I also want to see your gaze, Woo-jin, which will be warm like the color orange. It will be truly beautiful.

I'm also really looking forward to the new world I will greet with you, Woo-jin.

How beautiful will it be? Get well soon, and let's go record that beauty together.
Sent by Eun-ha, who will also be a part of Woo-jin's new world.
