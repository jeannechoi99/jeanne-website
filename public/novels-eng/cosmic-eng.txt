At that point where time cannot be defined, two lights collided. But nothing remained. The old light disappeared like that, and I departed beyond the distant darkness in search of new light. Without even a word of goodbye.

From some point on, I found myself strangely drawn to a twinkling light. After work, I developed a habit of trying to pierce through the cosmos beyond, gazing at the deep navy sky through the large window attached right next to my bed. With a job managing extraterrestrial exploration vessels, one might think it was an occupational hazard. Usually the sky was full of things shining blue, but that light had a peach color. Though I'd never actually seen the fruit, I once remembered seeing a painting in "History of the East" of an immortal sitting under a tree laden with peaches, gazing at a waterfall.

It was a light that couldn't even be detected by the extraterrestrial light observation system. There were quite a few stars that appeared for several days like this and then disappeared, so I tried not to pay attention, but strangely drawn by an alluring scent, I found myself unknowingly wishing every night while watching that twinkle—may it be a good night—praying for peaceful darkness. Though at the point when it's night for me, that place might not be dark.

As days passed, the light grew larger and larger. Its brightness, size, even its influence on me—everything. I couldn't understand it. Sometimes I stayed up all night staring at that light. Then I had no choice but to greet the morning while holding my stinging eyes.

It was about two months after I'd been watching the light alone. A signal was finally detected on the extraterrestrial light observation system. A very long time ago, when Earth perished and humanity had to flee to countless stars, they created personal extraterrestrial light observation systems to communicate with each other, separating everyone. That a signal was detected meant there was human civilization on that star, and if they were still using extraterrestrial light observation systems, this signal I detected would help it crash-land on one of the many extraterrestrial light observation systems on that star. I interpreted the signal I'd just detected and put it into the interstellar communicator. But without even time to think about what to transmit, I was connected to that star. Since I hadn't communicated in a while, with a trembling heart, I picked up the communicator and took my first words.

"...I love you."

With those words that escaped without my knowing, my first words became my last words. Well, at least for that day. Since even I who spoke them was bewildered, I think someone on that star, whose first words from humanity from that distant place were a confession of love, must have been even more bewildered. I thought they might even be angry. They might think I was a strange pervert loving someone whose face I didn't even know. But perhaps I'd unknowingly built up feelings while gazing at the light for two months—that the words circling in my mouth were "I love you."

Now there was only waiting. Along with the thought that perhaps the very act of picking up the communicator to speak was foolish. Because I couldn't know anything, not a single thing—who might be on that star, whether anyone was there at all, whether anyone there was even using an interstellar communicator made thousands of years ago.

While spending such tedious days, an unexpected answer came. Actually, saying I didn't expect it is a lie. It's pretending not to expect. Every day I glanced at the communicator, hoping perhaps the yellow light indicating received data had come on. I just thought I wasn't expecting it because I didn't want to be disappointed, didn't want to be hurt. I stared blankly at the yellow light of the communicator with surprised eyes for a long time, just as when I first discovered that star's light. After sufficient appreciation of the light, I picked up the communicator and listened to the data.

"Let's meet. I'll travel there soon. Please greet me with a smile."

Now feeling the emotion of anticipation had become self-defense. To greet them with a smile, to welcome that person, I had to have expectations and imagine good things.
