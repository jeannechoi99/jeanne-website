"Please, just let me buy this memory. I'll pay whatever price you name. Please..."
"This item has already been reserved by another customer."

Juhee, who had been desperately shouting, collapsed in front of the memory seller's firm attitude. This happened about once every two days at the Memory Exchange, so the security guards, accustomed to such scenes, carried Juhee to the break room and laid her down. At 11:14 PM, stores were already starting to turn off their lights one by one, but this place, operating regardless of day or night, was still bustling. Other buyers didn't look at Juhee being dragged away with sympathy, but rather with slightly frowning expressions as if she were in the way. As soon as Juhee and the security guard disappeared from view, they rushed to the seller, their eyes busily scanning the newly updated memory list.

The memory Juhee had tried to purchase was currently one of the most popular memories—a 7-minute memory from 1,082 years ago, of 54-year-old Kim Seoyun shedding tears when she first saw the moon during the early days of space tourism as a commercial product. The joy of facing the moon up close as an Earthling who had seen it every night from below the sky, the emotion of the luminous moonlight, the strange fear of confirming one's existence as a small being in the vast universe. The person next to Seoyun at that moment must have thought, "This person is incredibly happy right now."
Last week, a memory that sold for 6.7 billion won was from 834 years ago—an 18-minute memory of 23-year-old Nam Junyoung. Looking at a cute, delicate woman's face while talking, and at the end, suddenly embracing her—such a memory from a warm spring day in the park. Listen to the sound too. Ah, Junyoung had confessed to a woman he'd had a crush on for a long time, and she accepted his confession, so Junyoung suddenly embraced her. A grandfather sitting on a park bench watching this scene from afar would have thought, "That young man must be very happy right now."
Happy memories. The most expensively traded commodity in the society of 4194. Thousands of years ago, such things were called drugs. The moment they're absorbed into the body, you escape from reality, can easily avoid your worries, and simply get intoxicated with happiness. But from the moment the effect ends, they deliver pain greater than death.
Trading happy memories is illegal, but the method is simple. Visit the Memory Exchange hidden in each district. Browse the happy memory list. The list can be viewed by price or by category. The process of pricing happy memories is simple—the higher the demand, the higher the price. Happy memory categories are divided according to the "reason for happiness," with "love," "nature," and "achievement" being popular among customers. Among them, "love" has held the number one spot for several years. While browsing the list, a happy memory that you desperately want to seize catches your eye. (Later, you realize that this desire to seize stems from jealousy.) Then, if you pay the transaction price of that happy memory to the memory seller, the seller uploads that happy memory to the buyer's Brain Cloud. The Brain Cloud is each individual's memory storage space. Then the buyer just needs to retrieve that happy memory anytime and become happy.
But humans forget. Memories naturally fade over time. And humans distort. The more memories are recalled, the less they maintain their integrity. Finally, humans adapt. No matter how happy a memory was, one eventually comes to think of it as ordinary. One comes to crave bigger, bigger, bigger happiness. Thus happy memories became the ultimate drug of this era.
"Lee Juhee, are you still doing this? Are you not coming to your senses? You clearly promised that last time would be the last!"
Speaking in a sigh-filled, cold tone, but Yeongseo, Juhee's neighborhood friend, was the only one who took care of her. She had rushed over after receiving Juhee's message that she didn't have the strength to get up while in the break room. She was especially worried because it was a day with heavy snowfall.
"Get up quickly. It's snowing heavily outside now, perfect for catching a cold."
Then, after secretly glaring at the Memory Exchange security guards, Yeongseo linked arms with Juhee and practically dragged her out of the exchange. Snow was indeed falling heavily.
"...Sorry, as always."
"Taking care of you has its limits. How many times have I told you not to do this!"
"But..."
At Yeongseo's tearful eyes, Juhee read the room and couldn't continue her words. Juhee knows better than anyone that for the past few years, Yeongseo has been serving as the youth director of the "Happy Memory Eradication Movement Headquarters," diligently conducting various campaigns. So she's heard hundreds of times how much Yeongseo wants to separate her from that exchange, and furthermore, how much she wants to destroy all those exchanges. It would be reasonable for Yeongseo to hate Juhee and never meet her again, but that's not Yeongseo's purpose. So even now, she was boiling warm tea for Juhee, whom she was worried about having been in the cold exchange for several hours, bringing her to her own house.
"I... I didn't know it was bad at first. Everyone was doing it, so I thought it was normal. But you know, look at your face lately. Even when you're smiling, you're full of sadness!"
Juhee immediately responded as if refuting Yeongseo's words.
"Yeongseo, really, it's because you haven't tried it. When you recall happy memories, a smile naturally comes and sadness is forgotten. That's why I keep buying memories. You know that."
Realizing that what she just said would stoke Yeongseo's anger, Juhee made a "hup" sound and covered her mouth with her hand. As expected, upon hearing those words, Yeongseo shouted as if she couldn't take it anymore.
"You think happiness is somewhere far away and distant, but it was originally right next to you. You're seriously mistaken. And not just you. Because of happy memories, where was it, so absurd I can't even remember the name. What was it... Cotton Candy Land? Like our mom who left to find that nonsense, everyone, everyone... everyone's living in a crazy delusion. They're all voluntarily removing all happiness from their own lives, so why blame the government?"
Human society wasn't originally filled with anger, sadness, and regret like this. Using all sorts of methods, people lived recording life's moments. Happy memories like sunsets so red you might never see them again, meals prepared by your maternal grandmother whom you might see once a year, the deep blue waves seen at the beach on the first trip with friends—such moments, especially and necessarily, were completely preserved as records.
Records give power. Because they grant eternity to humans who cannot possess it. Writing, cameras, phones, recordings... all of these combine to become "data," and that data has the ability to tell you the time you left home today down to 0.1 seconds, and to record the entire history of humanity without missing anything. As the types of technology to record our lives broadened and deepened, the person who possessed that recorded data eventually gained power. Data has power beyond the past for humans who each have a Brain Cloud. The past is experience, and that experience gives value and lingering effects. Good experiences can be remembered as they are and used or learned from, and bad experiences can be reflected upon or immediately deleted. In other words, it's fair to say that data was the only driving force for growth.
This led to a "Data War" among people. People ruthlessly plundered each other's data, not only copying that data but "permanently deleting" the original data. Because they wanted data that only they possessed. Thus, the original owners of the data forgot the memories, experiences, and even the emotions contained in those records. The more data people lost to others, the more they became filled only with "garbage memories" they wanted to forget. Who would want to steal the moment of being scolded by a boss in front of workplace colleagues?
Eventually, global organizations had no choice but to make an extreme decision. To take away humans' "recording ability." Under the logic that humans, finite beings by nature, who seek to be infinite through records, must now stop that eternity. The sound of finite beings craving data, an entity that never disappears eternally, causing trouble and no longer being happy. Thus, humanity's data belonged only to each country's government, and citizens had no way to accumulate data. Not even their own daily lives.
But the price the government had to pay was heavier than expected. In a world dominated by records, people had already forgotten how to find happiness on their own. All happiness was a product made of fragments of the past, and whether happiness was felt at that moment in the past wasn't important. One just had to create "happy records." When records disappeared, happiness disappeared along with them.
"Happiness has ended."
This phrase spread like a slogan in a society that had become black and white after the government monopolized data. The rumor that it was no longer possible to pursue happiness in human society spread like wildfire, and before long, ordinary citizens became no more or less than intelligent animals primitively chasing pleasure. Because people gradually lost confidence in their own emotions. When they could no longer leave happy moments and sad moments as records, all of one's moments remained only as blurry memories. Like a dream, it became doubtful whether such things even really happened. So people came to crave something more certain, someone's perfectly preserved happiness. Afterward, only those who viciously exploited this to extort money, especially the Memory Exchange people, survived. Buying memories was the only way to obtain happiness. Thus, people became increasingly lazy, addicted to more and more memories, and consumed themselves.
Both Juhee and Yeongseo knew this story. It's history that anyone living in current human society necessarily comes to know. In that history, Happy Memory Eradication supporters like Yeongseo and happy memory addicts like Juhee have continued endless confrontation.
Of course, Juhee initially had no intention of becoming addicted to happy memories. Following friends who told her there was a good way to relieve stress, at first she only bought memories costing a few thousand won. But once tasted, easy happiness was hard to quit. As time passed and she found herself wanting more expensive happy memories, she felt a sense of crisis and wanted to stop, but without realizing it, she would always head back to the exchange. A common story among happy memory addicts. For several years since then, Juhee had been in and out of the Memory Exchange.
After Yeongseo burst out in anger, an awkward silence flowed between them, with only the sound of lifting and setting down cups being heard.
After a long-flowing silence, Yeongseo broke it.
"...You know. Why I came to oppose happy memories so strongly."
Every time Juhee collapsed at the Memory Exchange or got caught secretly visiting, she heard this story. Just two weeks ago, when she was caught looking at popular memory lists after secretly visiting the Memory Exchange, she heard again about the background of how Yeongseo came to take an extremely negative stance on happy memories.
Cotton Candy Land. The world Yeongseo's mother had dreamed of. Yeongseo's mother was also someone who habitually purchased happy memories. One day, the happy memory she purchased was the start of the problem. It was a memory in the "dreams" category—very large and fluffy cotton candy trees lined up along the street, the whole world was sweet pink, and when the memory was played, you felt as if the emotion of excitement was so full it overflowed. Up to that point might have been okay. But at the very beginning of that memory, there was a scene of taking a handful of white pills in the right hand and swallowing them all at once. This scene made Yeongseo's mother leave for Cotton Candy Land forever.
"Why did our mom share that memory with the neighborhood ladies... Copying memories is also a prohibited action. And absurdly, those pills were antidepressants our mom always took, so we had more than five bottles in our house. Six people went to that 'Cotton Candy Land' at once, and there's no one to blame."
Though it was a story from more than ten years ago, whenever Yeongseo told this story to Juhee, her hands trembled. Her eyes trembled together.
"I can't lose you too. I don't want to lose you. No, I absolutely must not lose you. I'll protect you somehow. Today too, when I heard you collapsed, I was so shocked..."
This time Yeongseo said with even her voice trembling.
Juhee was a soft-hearted person. Her emotional fluctuations were severe. Yeongseo naturally knew this, but she hadn't deliberately approached emotionally, using this as a weakness to prevent Juhee from buying more happy memories. The one sincere thing was her desire not to lose Juhee.
"The happy memories you bought... they ultimately make you perform. They were someone's happy moments, sure. But they belong to that person, not you. Remember that."
Yeongseo said to Juhee with moistened eyes.
"Promise me you really won't go to the exchange anymore."
More strongly conveying sincerity than usual today, Juhee felt even more sorry and said in a subdued voice.
"Okay...I'm sorry."
Juhee, who had been looking down, moved her gaze to the window behind her. Looking at the streetlight, she could see it was still snowing heavily. Snow was piling up high on the parked cars too. Following Juhee who was looking out the window, Yeongseo also quietly looked at the falling snow. Perhaps because of the snow, the atmosphere became calm in an instant. Taking advantage of the calmed atmosphere, Juhee began to speak.
"I thought a lot about whether to tell you this, but now that I've really promised you not to go to the Memory Exchange, I'll tell you. Actually, recently there was a happy memory I really wanted to buy. Five hundred won. A happy memory no one covets."
"Five hundred won? You could go buy it right now. And you were trying to buy a memory worth tens of billions today... Why haven't you bought it yet?"
Yeongseo answered in a surprised voice. It wasn't an answer meant to support buying such a memory, but she was simply surprised because it was an endlessly low price compared to the memories Juhee usually tried to buy.
"That happy memory will obviously end up being an unhappy memory for me. It's a memory from my first love Chan, who died two years ago."
With those words as the end, Juhee and Yeongseo were in silence for a moment.
When someone dies, if they apply in advance, the few happy memories that were most intense for that person—that is, memories where happiness remains even faintly until the end—can be automatically sold at the Memory Exchange. Usually people apply with a feeling of leaving behind an inheritance. That's why Juhee's first love had applied in advance, so Jung Chan's memories were listed on the happy memory list.
"How did you know Chan's happy memory was being sold?"
"A few weeks ago, I was casually browsing the sales list out of boredom, and I got curious about the lowest-priced memories. So I looked, and 'Jung Chan' was among the sellers. That's how I knew. The registration date was exactly the same as Chan's death anniversary."
Unlike before, Yeongseo answered without being able to meet Juhee's eyes.
"But... you could remember Chan that way at least. If it were me, I would have just bought it. Why have you only bought useless memories until now?"
"Just thinking about it makes my insides crumble, but if I feel even one breeze from that happy moment when we were together... you'll be able to see my memories at the Memory Exchange the next day."
Juhee said while meaninglessly stirring the cup with little tea left.
"But well, since I'm really not going to the Memory Exchange anymore, it doesn't matter. I'll just leave it for someone else to buy. The price is cheap so it'll sell quickly."
Hearing Juhee's words, Yeongseo made a somewhat troubled expression, but soon said what she was going to say.
"Since you brought up Chan, I just now remembered, sorry, I was so busy with my work that I completely forgot to tell you this. I'm telling you too late, sorry. Actually, Chan asked me to make sure you bought the happy memory that would be uploaded to the Memory Exchange. You remember when I visited the hospital alone because you were urgently called to work and were busy, right? Chan said it then. Probably only one memory would be uploaded, and no one would covet that memory so the price would be extremely low."
At the sudden and belated story about Chan, Juhee showed eyes of great surprise. Chan had never once purchased a happy memory in his life. He even nagged whenever Juhee bought one or two. So when she discovered Chan's memory on the sales list a few weeks ago, she was already greatly surprised by the fact that Chan had applied in advance to automatically sell his happy memory. At that time, she just moved past the question thinking, he probably did it because his memory was precious. Because thinking of Chan made her heart ache again. But to think that memory was for her. The question she had briefly avoided bloomed again, so she couldn't help but be more surprised at Yeongseo's words. Seeing Juhee making a flustered expression, Yeongseo continued speaking.
"So buy this memory. This is the last, truly last time I'll allow it!"
Yeongseo smiled slightly and held Juhee's hand. Instead of answering with words, Juhee smiled together with her.
When day broke, Juhee put on her coat to leave Yeongseo's house. She was very tired from not sleeping a wink due to her complicated thoughts. Before leaving, she covered Yeongseo, who had fallen asleep on the sofa while talking about various things until late in the early morning, with a blanket.
She walked toward the Memory Exchange, cutting through the cold morning air, and the snow was still falling heavily. When she arrived at the exchange, the salesperson recognized the familiar face and greeted her with a light nod.
"You collapsed last night but came again. What memory are you looking for this time?"
Juhee pondered for a moment how to answer.
"...I want to buy 'Jung Chan's' memory. He died two years ago so his memory would have been automatically sold... And this is really the last time."
As if lightly dismissing Juhee's determination that this was really the last time, having heard it every time, the salesperson found the memory Juhee wanted to purchase at once with her usual expression and displayed it on the screen in front of Juhee.
"Please check once more if this is the happy memory you want to purchase, and if correct, I'll proceed with payment."
Juhee stared at the screen showing Chan's memory for a long time. Five hundred won. It was the cheapest price at the Memory Exchange. It was somewhat absurd that Chan's happy moment, his happiness, was priced at such a trivial amount.
"Who would buy something like this..."
Muttering with a bitter smile, a counterquestion suddenly entered Juhee's mind.
'Then, would it have been better if it were more expensive?'
If Chan's happy memory had sold for about 5.8 billion won, countless people would have coveted, consumed, and ruined his memory. Perhaps this trivial price that no one would buy was actually purely protecting Chan's memory.
In Juhee's Brain Cloud, dozens of happy memories were currently stored. When she first visited the Memory Exchange, it was just once out of curiosity. A certain young person's university acceptance moment discovered in the "Life Turning Point" category. The joy and sense of achievement in that memory captivated Juhee. After that it was easy. The delusion that you could taste pure happiness if you just had money.
But Juhee gradually needed more and more happy memories. The initial happy memories had now faded like old photographs. The emotions that were vividly transmitted at first now felt numb, as if hearing someone else's story. Then she discovered Chan's memory remaining on the other side of the memories.
Yeongseo's words came to mind. "Mom who left to find Cotton Candy Land." Juhee thought she could now understand. Yeongseo's mother might have become addicted to happy memories and given up everything in reality. Chasing happiness like cotton candy—sweet but without substance. And she might have been walking the exact same path.
Juhee went through the happy memories one by one in her Brain Cloud, those that still had preservation power after purchase. What did all of those leave for her now? Only emptiness in the name of happiness.
On the other hand, memories with Chan were different. Remaining only as memories purely by Juhee's own memory power, they faded as time passed, but even in that fading, there was something clear. The fact that she was with Chan, and the emotion of being truly happy then. Those moments that were entirely her own, not anyone else's.
Only then did Juhee begin to understand why Chan had left a request to buy his happy memory, despite anticipating that she would have a hard time from longing if she thought of him. Juhee spoke to the memory seller with a brighter expression than when she entered the memory exchange.
"Yes, this is the right memory. I'll pay right now."
The memory seller said with a somewhat puzzled expression.
"Every time you come, you only buy high-priced memories, this is the first time buying a memory at this price level. Uploading to Brain Cloud... ah, it's completed now."
Simultaneously with the words that uploading was complete, Juhee played Chan's happy memory that she had just purchased from the Brain Cloud. It was as expected. No, actually it was a bit more ordinary than expected, so she was disappointed. But in that memory, she was truly smiling brightly. The message Chan left last was right here. Juhee at the Memory Exchange at that moment also smiled brightly.
"Thank you. And I really won't come anymore. Really. Thank you until now."
Juhee greeted the salesperson and walked toward the exchange door with an expression showing no lingering attachment.
As Juhee left the Memory Exchange, she suddenly remembered her grandmother's words from childhood. "Even if you don't leave it as a record, you can keep it in your heart. That lasts longer." At the time, she couldn't understand. But now she thought she knew a little. Perhaps her own blurry but real memories were more precious than others' perfectly preserved happy memories.
Because the exchange was deep in an alley, Juhee walked alone through the alley for a while. Snow had fallen all night, creating a pure white world. Reaching the end of the alley, she saw a small child on the wide walking path outside the alley. Juhee thought she should stick closer to the alley wall and wait until the child passed, as she might greatly startle the child if she went out now.
The child was looking up at the snowy sky with sparkling eyes. Soon, perhaps because a snowflake got in the child's eye, surprised by the coldness, the child shook their head back and forth. The child's attention now went to the snow piled at their feet. With gloved hands, scooping up a handful of snow and observing it at length once more. Not knowing how to play with the snow, dropping it back on the ground as it was. Nevertheless, so excited by the pure white world, the child crouched down in earnest and continued observing the snow. The child's fur hat was also gradually turning white.
"Momma! Dadda! Look at dis!"
Still a young child whose pronunciation wasn't proper. At the voice of the child excitedly calling for mom and dad with clumsy pronunciation, Juhee quietly laughed "poot" at the cuteness. Forgetting the fact that she should leave the alley and hurry home to wash up, she kept watching the child. Soon hearing the sound of the child's parents approaching, Juhee quietly hid in the alley again.
"Yes, our Gyuyoung, you like the snow, don't you?"
"Yes! Snow good! Snow good!"
The child smiled brightly looking at the parents. The parents also crouched down to match the child's eye level.
"Gyuyoung, you pack snow like this. Like you scooped snow with both hands earlier, scoop a handful of snow, that's right, scoop it like that and press firmly up and down, press firmly, turn it a bit more, that's right well done, press firmly again. Then a round snowball is complete like this!"
Being the child's first time packing snow, they seemed to fumble a bit, but soon followed the parents and made a snowball.
"Momma, look!"
"You made it so well? Now, if you put what Gyuyoung made on top of mommy's... ta-da, it becomes a snowman!"
"Wow!"
The child clapped with small hands looking at the snowman. Seeing the brightly smiling child, the parents also looked at each other and smiled. They look happy. Happiness is visible in them. Their pure feeling of happiness is transmitted to Juhee as well. Even though it's not being recorded, even knowing it won't exist forever, they are happy. Juhee saw for the first time the expressions of people being happy through a route other than happy memories. Nevertheless, Juhee knew at once that the emotion of that expression was happiness. An emotion so pure it's white, seeming not to know sadness, that makes the observer somehow choke up for some reason.
The family stood up again and began to continue their walk. A small snowman was left where they had been. A snowman without eyes, without a nose, without arms made of branches—such a snowman that anyone would see as just a pile of snow. But somehow that snowman seemed to be making eye contact with Juhee, as if seriously telling her something. Feeling embarrassed as if she had hidden in darkness trying to steal brightness, Juhee quickly exited the alley.
Juhee walked a bit toward home and looked back slightly. The young child and parents were already walking far away. Nevertheless, despite viewing from this distance, their happiness was still felt by Juhee. The child suddenly lay down in the snow. From far away, the parents' burst of laughter was heard. As if watching a scene from a happy memory, Juhee stared at that family for a long time while turned around. While finding it fascinating and imagining pleasantly whether such a moment would come to her. Then, as if making eye contact with the child's mother, she hurriedly turned her head and continued on her way.
Just as when snow falls the whole world becomes white, a happy memory dyes that person's whole heart with happiness. But when spring comes, snow disappears, so snow is not eternal. Happy memories are the same. Not existing eternally, sometimes you only realize it was a "happy memory" after it disappears. But after spring passes, after heavy rains subdue sad memories and autumn dresses the trees, the snowy season comes again. We remember that fact. In life too, happiness always comes again. Whether we keep it as happiness is up to us.
The family Juhee watched probably didn't think this moment was eternal either. But enough to be transmitted even to Juhee watching from afar, perhaps they felt happiness in the purity of the child being greatly delighted by what might be nothing—heavy snow. And Juhee thought, wouldn't that happiness inform them of happiness and be deeply embedded in their hearts, enabling them to feel and dream of yet another happiness?
Groundless pleasant imaginings. No actually, the basis is happy memories. The belief that those people in that happiness, their eyes and tone, will remain the same is what's groundless. But rather because it's groundless, the vague hope that that imagination can be realized makes humans live. Making them expect and feel excited, continuing to draw life. Investing, wishing, sometimes wasting for that future that may not even come. Nevertheless, humans hope for happiness.
Thus Juhee walked through the quiet space, focusing on the sound—pook, pook—from beneath her feet when stepping on the deeply piled snow. Feeling happiness in the quietness where you could hear the sound of snow piling. Raising her head, she saw snow-covered mountains in the distance. The majesty of nature she had forgotten while living. Juhee thought about how small human existence is under nature, and how grateful she was to be able to enjoy snow, one of nature's beautiful gifts. Looking at the many footprints left on the snowy path, she thought that perhaps this moment of hers right now might be a memory someone would pay billions to purchase. But Juhee would not sell this memory. Though it would fade someday, she decided to keep it. Because future Juhee would surely be feeling some happiness, unknown now, as much as it fades. Without buying happy memories.
