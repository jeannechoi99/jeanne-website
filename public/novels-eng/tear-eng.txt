Jewel Tears

Juyeon, who lived in a mountainous village in Gangwon-do, would lie on a hill in the neighborhood park with her parents every night, gazing at the night sky for tens of minutes.

The moonlight and the sparkling starlight beside it were so lovely that she couldn't just pass them by. Sometimes a shooting star would fall, and she could even make a wish! Although she saw the moon and stars in the night sky every day, Juyeon never failed to have this thought: 'It's beautiful...'.

Juyeon wondered how those stars shone so beautifully. She thought they were like diamonds hanging in the sky.

However, when Juyeon asked her mom, her mom always gave the same answer: "The stars are beautiful because they are sad."

Juyeon couldn't understand her mom's words.

This was because she cried when she was sad, and when she happened to see herself crying before, she wasn't making a pretty face.

So, when she asked her mom why the stars were beautiful because they were sad, her mom would always just smile and not answer.

The next day, when Juyeon came home from school, she found her mom packing.
"Mom, why are you suddenly packing?"

Her mom replied: "Grandma has been sick and was hospitalized recently, remember? So tonight, Mom is going to the hospital to stay overnight. Can you manage well with just Dad for one night without Mom?"

Juyeon's sick grandmother had recently been hospitalized. Juyeon was worried, and since Grandma needed Mom now, and Mom must miss Grandma too, Juyeon spoke with a cheerful voice: "Yes, of course, Mom. Tell Grandma that Juyeon is worried about her very much and loves her very much!"

Thanks to Juyeon's bright words, her mom smiled broadly.

Juyeon loved her mom's wide smile. When her mom smiled, Juyeon became happy and smiled too.

Recently, however, since Grandma was sick, her mom had been making sad expressions often. She also shed tears many times.

When Juyeon saw her mom making such an expression, she felt sad too, and her own expression would become sad.

That's why Juyeon always tried to smile brightly.

That night, Juyeon went out to the park with her dad, without her mom.

They climbed to the very top of the hill and lay down on the grass. Before, when she came out to see the stars, Juyeon lay between her mom and dad, but today, one side was empty.

So, Juyeon felt cold on one side. She missed her mom. "Dad, I wish Mom would come back soon."

Hearing that, Juyeon's dad replied: "Yes, Mom must miss Juyeon too. But in the same way, Grandma must have missed Mom a lot, just like you do. Because Grandma hasn't seen Mom, her daughter, often. So, let's try to endure tonight so Mom and Grandma can spend some time together. You're not waiting alone; you're waiting with Dad, so you can do it, right?"

Juyeon missed her mom, but after hearing her dad's words, she decided to be brave tonight for her mom.

"Yes, Dad. Instead, let's watch the beautiful stars a little longer before we go."

So, that night, Juyeon and her dad talked about this and that while looking at the stars.

Then, Juyeon suddenly recalled the question she asked her mom every day. Since her dad hadn't answered that question, she was curious about his thoughts.

"Dad, do you know why the stars are so pretty and twinkling?"

Her dad remained silent for a few seconds, then answered: "Juyeon, Dad's dad... your paternal grandfather, you don't remember him, do you?"

"No, because he passed away when I was very young."

"When Dad was young, he also used to come out with his mom and dad at night and look up at the night sky. At that time, your grandfather told me a story, would you like to hear it?"

Juyeon nodded silently.

"Juyeon. The stars, you know, they are all friends. But just as the Earth revolves around the sun, the stars keep moving. They also die when their lifespan runs out... You learned at school that a shooting star is a star that dies and falls, right? Since stars are friends, when a friend's lifespan is over, they cry very sadly. Shedding tears more than we can imagine. But since it's not just one or two stars dying every day, the stars have no choice but to cry every day. Conversely, many new stars are born every day, so they make many new friends. They laugh and greet each other, talk about this and that, and are happy. This is how the stars live. They laugh, and then they are sad. Just like our lives..."

At her dad's last words, Juyeon didn't know what to say and remained quiet.

This was because she didn't exactly understand what her dad meant.

"Hahaha... Dad said something too difficult at the end. Yes, my daughter is still young, so you won't understand. But when you become an adult, you might understand what Dad said. So, don't forget the story Dad told you and always remember it when you look at the stars."

"Yes, Dad. That was a really good story!"

Although they got home later than usual because of her dad's long story, Juyeon wasn't very tired.

Juyeon thought and thought about the story her dad told her until she fell asleep.

The next day, her mom returned with a sad expression, unlike the cheerful face she had when she left.

Juyeon wanted her mom to smile again, so she ran to her mom, smiling, and hugged her. But her mom only gave a faint smile. Juyeon looked into her mom's eyes.

Her mom was crying. Because of her mom's tears, her eyes sparkled. Just like the stars Juyeon saw last night.

Juyeon's mom spoke to her dad through her tears: "Honey... Mother passed away. She passed away..."

Her mom trailed off on the last words and collapsed, crying hysterically like a child. Juyeon was unfamiliar with this side of her mom.

And Juyeon suddenly felt as if the world around them had stopped and turned black and white, with only herself, her mom, and her dad moving.

She couldn't hear the sound of the fish swimming in the fish tank, nor the ticking of the clock, nor the sound of the drama on TV.

Only her mom's crying could be heard, and only the sorrow within her mom's cry could be felt. She saw her mom's tears falling to the floor, and those tears seemed to turn into ice, slowly freezing the living room.

Along with the teardrops she was shedding, and the teardrops her dad was shedding.

Afterward, Grandma's funeral ended surprisingly quickly.

And when Juyeon returned home, she couldn't believe that her grandmother had passed away.

She felt as if her grandmother would ring the doorbell right now and cheerfully say, "My Juyeon~ Grandma came to make you mung bean pancakes!"

The dinner her mom made didn't taste good either. Juyeon was very disappointed because her dad couldn't eat dinner with them due to several days of delayed work.

And that night, Juyeon wasn't in the mood to go out to see the stars because she was sad, but she was led by her mom's hand and reluctantly went to the park and lay down with her mom.

Juyeon and her mom didn't speak for a long time. It was her mom who broke the silence: "Juyeon, do you know why the stars sparkle?"

Juyeon was a little surprised that her mom asked the question she usually asked.

"...The stars are beautiful because they are sad. Just like Mom always said..."

"That's right, the stars are beautiful because they are sad. Juyeon, do you know that all the stars are friends?"

"Yes, Dad told me that story. That when one star dies, its friend star cries, and when a new star is born, its friend star laughs."

"...Juyeon. When a person is sad, very sad, what happens?"

"They cry. Just like... when Mom cried."

"Yes, that's right. They cry when they are sad. You know that it's the same for stars, right? When stars lose a friend they considered very precious, they shed a lot of tears. As much as they loved their friend. But because of those tears, or rather, thanks to those tears, the stars can sparkle. In space, tears sparkle like jewels."

The moment Juyeon heard her mom's words, she remembered thinking that her mom's eyes sparkled like stars when she cried.

She started to understand a little bit the reason her mom said the stars were sparkling.

"But Mom, can the stars really sparkle so beautifully just from being sad?"

"No. As I said before, when a star's friend dies, they shed tears proportional to the size of the love they had for that friend. Since the stars loved each other, they must have played together often, talked a lot, and laughed a lot. Just like when you play with your friends, Jin-i and Soyeon, and you feel very fun and happy. But the stars are so sad because the friend they loved so much disappeared quickly. They are sad because they were happy."

Hearing this story, Juyeon found the starlight both beautiful and sad at the same time. Her mom continued to speak: "Juyeon, tears shed from sadness might actually be like jewels. The reason you are sad is because you had moments when you felt happy. Look at the starlight in the sky. How beautiful it is..."

The starlight in the night sky was truly beautiful.

However, the starlight no longer seemed only beautiful, as it had before. This was because the sparkle of the starlight was tears. Beautiful jewel tears.

"Mom is very sad that Grandma passed away. It's even more so thinking that I can never see Grandma again. But, Grandma gave Mom so many precious memories before she left. When I recall those memories, Mom becomes so happy. So, when Mom misses Grandma too much, I will smile while thinking of those memories. Juyeon, you can do that too, right?"

"Yes, Mom. I also have many precious memories with Grandma. For example, last year..."

Juyeon and her mom talked about her maternal grandmother until late that night.

And when Juyeon looked up at the night sky one last time before going home, she suddenly thought that the stars in the night sky looked a lot like her maternal grandmother.

Her maternal grandmother was both sad and beautiful to Juyeon.
