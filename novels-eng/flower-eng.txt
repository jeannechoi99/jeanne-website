The Pretty Flower

On a peaceful lawn, there was a big tree.

The big tree provided wide shade even in the hot summer, allowing people to rest comfortably in the shade.

It was one day.
Flower seeds began to fly in on the wind from the neighboring town. The flower seeds landed in a place that received very good sunlight.

However, the wind played a trick and intentionally dropped one flower seed into the big tree's wide shade.
"Heh heh, you grow up lonely here without any friends!"

The wind said in a mean voice and then left.
Just one flower seed was left alone in the wide shade of the big tree.

A few days later, flowers began to bloom in the sunlight.
It was the first day the flowers in the sunlight had all bloomed.

The flowers bloomed closely together in the spot that received good sunlight. Their petals had a shimmering purple color in the sun.

Passersby enjoyed picnics in the sunlight and admired the pretty flowers sparkling in the sun.
"Oh my, how pretty they are. Look at these flowers."

"Indeed. The flowers are so lovely."
The flowers were very happy to hear the people's compliments.
"I guess we're very pretty. The sunlight is so warm, too."

"Hoo hoo, I know what you mean."
But look at that flower seed that fell into the big tree's wide shade. It had barely sprouted a tiny shoot.

It was hard to tell if this shoot was a flower or just a weed. Seeing the shoot, the flowers in the sunlight said:

"Look at that one in the shade. It hasn't even grown a flower bud yet."

"Tsk, tsk, tsk. What a pity. It should be growing up pretty under the warm sunlight like us."
"We're happy right now, so it's fine."

"Hahaha, that's right. What does it matter? We're the best. We don't need to worry about it. It won't be as pretty as us if it stays in that shade anyway."

The flowers in the sunlight were slightly worried about the flower that had fallen into the big tree's wide shade. However, because people were admiring them so much, they quickly forgot.

It was the second day the flowers in the sunlight had bloomed. The flowers in the sunlight bloomed even wider today, and the purple color of their petals became even prettier.

Passersby admired the flowers in the sunlight.
"Wow, look at these flowers. There are such beautiful purple flowers."

"It's really true. They might be the prettiest flowers I've ever seen."
"I should take some pictures of these flowers."

'Click-' 'Click-', people took out their phones and took many pictures of the flowers in the sunlight. The flowers in the sunlight looked very happy again today.

"How pretty must we be for them to take so many pictures?"
"How pretty? The prettiest on this lawn, of course. That's why every person who passes by calls us beautiful."

The flowers in the sunlight laughed happily and chatted pleasantly.
However, the seed that fell into the big tree's wide shade had only just sprouted a flower bud.

That flower bud was much smaller than the buds of the flowers in the sunlight. The flowers in the sunlight looked at the bud in the big tree's wide shade and said this:

"Oh dear, look at that tiny flower bud."
"I know, right. Will it even become a flower being that small?"
"Even fully grown, it won't be as pretty as us. Hohoho!"

The flowers in the sunlight once again laughed at the seed that had fallen into the big tree's wide shade. This was because they were simply happy receiving compliments from people.

It was the third day the flowers in the sunlight had bloomed. They were even more splendid flowers than yesterday. The compliments directed at the flowers in the sunlight were endless.

"Look at those purple flowers over there."
"They're so beautiful. I want to sit next to those flowers."
The flowers in the sunlight smiled broadly as they heard the praise.

But today was a little different. This was because the flower seed that had fallen into the big tree's wide shade finally bloomed!

The flower in the big tree's wide shade was very happy to see the world for the first time.
But that joy did not last long.

Looking beside it, the flowers in the sunlight were blooming so beautifully. The flowers in the sunlight seemed much bigger, showier, and sparklier than itself.

It felt like a very small and ordinary flower.
"I wish I could be as pretty as those flowers in the sun. I'm so envious."

The flower in the big tree's wide shade shed tears.
Meanwhile, the flowers in the sunlight also discovered that the flower in the big tree's wide shade had bloomed.

However, instead of congratulating it, they immediately made fun of it.
"Hahaha, look at that tiny flower. Will people even see it?"

"Hehehe, I know. Being in the shade, its color looks dark and dull."
"It's not pretty either."

The flower in the big tree's wide shade was deeply hurt by the words of the flowers in the sunlight.

It also wanted to receive plenty of sunlight and live happily like the flowers in the sun.
It was the fourth day the flowers in the sunlight had bloomed.

Day by day, the flowers in the sunlight grew prettier. Passersby always complimented them.

"My, these flowers seem even prettier than yesterday."
"I know, right. I need to take some of these flowers to my room. My room isn't very pretty right now."

It happened in an instant. A passing girl began to pick the flowers in the sunlight, one by one.

The girl, who had collected a handful of beautiful purple flowers, left with a bright smile.

However, the remaining flowers in the sunlight could not smile. This was because they became afraid of their future.

Meanwhile, the flower in the big tree's wide shade bloomed more fully today than yesterday.

It could only watch quietly from a distance as the flowers in the sunlight left in the girl's arms.
It was the fifth day the flowers in the sunlight had bloomed.

The flowers in the sunlight, which they thought would be beautiful forever, looked a little wilted today. And they sparkled less than yesterday.

Passersby didn't even notice the flowers in the sunlight. The flowers in the sunlight spoke sadly.
"What should we do, I guess we're not pretty anymore."

"I know, right. People aren't complimenting us anymore by calling us pretty."
But the flower in the big tree's wide shade was growing quickly.

Slowly but steadily, it was growing little by little. It was still smaller than the flowers in the sunlight, but it was definitely growing hard.

It was the sixth day the flowers in the sunlight had bloomed. Today was a day of heavy rain. Rumble, boom, thunder was crashing.

Zz-rip-, Oh, look, there's lightning too.
The flowers in the sunlight were very scared of the rain, thunder, and lightning.

And the raindrops hitting their petals hurt them very much.
The flower in the big tree's wide shade was also very scared of the rain, thunder, and lightning.

However, it wasn't hurt. This was because the big tree blocked the rain. The flower in the big tree's wide shade whispered to the big tree:
"Thank you, Tree."

It was the seventh day the flowers in the sunlight had bloomed. Maybe because there was a lot of rain yesterday, the sky is clear today without a single cloud.

Many people came to the lawn to enjoy the sunlight. But today, people are saying something a little different.

Should we listen together?
"Look at those flowers in the sun over there. They look so wilted and ugly."
"I don't want to sit next to flowers like that. They might smell."

Hearing this, the flowers in the sunlight started to cry.
"Boo hoo hoo, I guess we're ugly now."

"We thought we'd be the prettiest on this lawn forever."
The flowers in the sunlight, drenched in rain, had wilted.

They no longer sparkled with purple, nor were they blooming big and beautifully.
But the flower in the big tree's wide shade was different.

Since the big tree had blocked all the rain, it hadn't been touched by a single drop. People who walked past the flowers in the sunlight and headed for the shade discovered the flower in the big tree's wide shade.

And they said this to the flower:
"Oh my, look at this cute flower."
"It's so adorable. The petite purple color is pretty, too."

"This flower is the prettiest on this lawn."
The compliments that were originally directed at the flowers in the sunlight were now directed at the flower in the big tree's wide shade.

The flower in the big tree's wide shade smiled brightly upon hearing the compliment. And it said:
"I am a pretty flower, too."

The people resting comfortably in the cool shade smiled. The flower in the big tree's wide shade beside them also smiled and enjoyed a happy time together.
