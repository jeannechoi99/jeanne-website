Shining Pure White

"The next stop is **△△ Middle School, △△ Middle School**."

That announcement is one I always hear on my way to work. It's been over 20 years since I started living in this neighborhood, and I've been seeing **△△ Middle School** for many years.

When you live in the same neighborhood for a long time, you find that a memory of your own is planted at each bus stop. Looking at the scenery outside the bus window every morning, I often smile inwardly at the small memories I recall every day, even though the view is always the same.

This particular stop gives me a heart-warming feeling. Sometimes, I want to get off at the **△△ Middle School** stop and go back to those days, feeling the same emotions. Seeing students in the same uniforms that haven't changed for decades go to school, I become the innocent me from back then, who could express shy yet honest feelings.

You could probably guess, but this stop reminds me of my first love. The kind of memories that make my eyes look wistful yet bring a warm smile to my face when I think of them. Since I bought a chocolate bar this morning that reminded me of him, I want to tell the story of Chan. The story of an adolescent girl who didn't yet know how to control her feelings.

---

Lunchtime was the time when Chan and I were physically closest. As usual, our class was the first to get lunch. That day, my favorite fruit, tangerines, was served, so I was eating quickly to get to the dessert.

But soon, this thought started floating in my head: 'Chan would like this sweet tangerine, too'.

Suddenly, some unknown courage seeped out from somewhere. *I* could give this to Chan?

I couldn't say a single word in front of the person I liked. Not just words, I probably couldn't do anything at all. If I was walking down the hallway with somewhere to go and saw Chan approaching from a distance, I would immediately turn around and hide somewhere. If I accidentally ran into Chan in the school library and he greeted me first, my face would instantly flush red. I would bow my head to hide my face, which was red up to my forehead, and just manage to wave my hand before passing by.

We weren't always this awkward. "Oh, you got the same question wrong as me?" That was Jeong Chan, holding out his palm to me. It was right after grading a pop quiz a few days into the second year. We had never spoken a word to each other, but who could refuse a high five when he spoke with such a lively voice and expression?

That was my first impression of Chan. We touched hands before even becoming friends. A high five wasn't special, but Chan's high five came out of nowhere, so it was bound to stay in my memory for a long time.

As you can tell, Chan was an outgoing boy who often played tricks on me. At first, those pranks just felt annoying. But during one gym class, the sight of him playing basketball, sweating and laughing, made my heart pound. Anyone who's experienced falling for someone, even once, knows it. They know that the feeling arrives for an unexplainable reason at that moment. Since then, up until the second semester of third grade, Chan had become someone who made my heart flutter.

Anyway, once the courage started, it traveled through my veins, making my heart pound even harder. I couldn't hear what my friends were talking about because I was only thinking about giving Chan a tangerine during the meal. If someone spoke to me, I just vaguely smiled and brushed it off, even though I didn't understand. In that moment, the dilemma that made my heart pound was more important.

Finally, that pounding led me to clench my fist.

'I have to give it to Chan'.

*If you enjoy it, I'll be happy.* With just this thought, I put the tangerine into my coat pocket.

But the moment I stood in front of Chan's Class 6, the courage I had earlier evaporated. I called Junseok, Chan's best friend and helper in my one-sided love, but Junseok was just making a fuss next to me. Honestly, he was more flustered than I was.

As expected, Chan was out playing basketball with his friends, and his seat was empty. Our first plan was to leave the tangerine on Chan's desk and leave before he returned. But then Chan wouldn't know who gave it to him, and thinking that the meaning of *me* giving it would be lost, I decided to think of a different plan.

I couldn't think of anything. I just fidgeted with the tangerine in my pocket. While Junseok and I were anxiously tapping our feet, Chan walked into the classroom, his shirt buttons slightly undone, sweating profusely from playing basketball.

At the back of the classroom, Junseok and I became even more anxious. Not only was lunchtime nearly over, but Chan seemed to have seen me already. I just fretted more internally, repeating 'What should I do' over and over. It would only take three steps forward to place the tangerine on his desk and leave.

The desire to give him the tangerine swelled uncontrollably the moment I saw Chan, while the courage to do so shrank. Would I fail to break down the wall I could never cross, even today? I had neglected my crush for months, remaining a spectator. I had the expectation that today, I could finally become a true participant and fill a small part, but I couldn't bring myself to move my feet.

'Taa-ra-ra-ra Ttan-dan Ttan-dan-'

I hadn't realized how much time had passed while I was agonizing. Lunchtime was already over! The bell signaling the end of lunch sounded like the bell sealing the fate of my love.

My mind went blank. Why had I decided to give him a tangerine in the first place? Was it the wish that this tangerine would be delivered to Chan, and my small feelings would be delivered, too? Or had my feelings grown so large that they were no longer confined to just existing within me, but had to be expressed physically? Or maybe, I simply hated the sight of myself acting like a fool, just watching him for months while having a crush?

No, this isn't the time for such worries. Fortunately, our school bell ring was long, so I still had about 10 seconds to decide.

"Min Hyojung, hurry-!"

'Ugh, I don't care'.

Thanks to Junseok's prodding next to me, and the few remaining seconds of the bell, the courage transmitted to my toes made my body move towards Chan's desk. I could see nothing but the corner of Chan's desk. That corner of the desk was the first place to hold my heart, after all. Staring only at that corner as if a blurry filter was on, I strode forward. I practically threw my small gift down, and without looking back, burst out of Class 6's door and ran to my own classroom.

My heart wasn't pounding from running, but from being so embarrassed by the situation. The whole thing happened in the 13 seconds of that bell. But since I poured all my courage into it, it felt like 13 days.

I sat down at my seat as if nothing had happened, but I couldn't concentrate on the class at all. My mind felt completely filled with orange circles. Afraid that I might run into Chan on the way home, I ran straight home as soon as my class meeting ended.

As usual, I ate dinner and opened my textbook to study, but I couldn't concentrate for even a minute because I was curious how the tangerine I left had been delivered to Chan. In that moment of spending unproductive time at my desk,

'Ting-'

10:46 PM. One message that made me cry, and three letters:

'Min Hyojung'

It was a text from Chan. The moment I saw my name, I covered my mouth and couldn't move. I could clearly hear my heart pounding in my ears.

'Min Hyojung?'

Since I didn't reply, Chan sent another message 10 minutes later. I wanted to ask Junseok for help, but he had already said he was tired and going to bed at 10 PM.

I was afraid I might say something wrong, but unwilling to miss this chance for a conversation, I tightly closed my eyes and continued the chat. Chan said he enjoyed the tangerine and that he liked fruits too. Every single word from Chan seemed precious.

Since the moment I started liking Chan, I was too shy to talk to him, which was almost the same as blocking communication myself. So, I was thankful to have been born in the 21st century, where I could continue a conversation like this using an electronic device. I could hide my flushed, bright red face and smile comfortably. I offered my thanks to everyone who developed smartphones and chat apps. As the conversation slowly continued, my mind seemed to calm down, but my heart was still pounding.

After some small talk, Chan said:

'Next time, don't just zoom~ in and zoom~ out of our classroom. Come slo~wly, hang out slo~wly, and leave slo~wly.'

I realized what it meant to "scream inside". And then, a warm feeling filled me from my toes to my head. Did Chan already know all my feelings? Was Chan starting to think of me too? Did Chan enjoy the tangerine I gave him?

Afraid of waking my sibling, I couldn't make a sound, so I twisted my body this way and that, trying to somehow express the emotions I was feeling. Anyone who saw me might think I was crazy. But the feelings I got from that one sentence were so huge that I couldn't help it. I felt like I would burst if I didn't let out even a little bit.

I wasn't sure if it was embarrassment or joy. Either way, I was happy, tapping my feet excitedly, because it felt like I had slightly reached Chan's heart through my small gift. My tangerine would be my presence itself to Chan. I had become the girl who was just a classmate in 2nd grade, and then suddenly ran over and practically threw a tangerine at him.

There is Kim Chunsu's poem, 'Flower,' isn't there? My teacher introduced it in Korean class once. The moment I realized that the tangerine had reached Chan with the name 'heart,' the butterflies in my heart flew all over me, filling me completely with Chan.

My mother found me strange, smiling vaguely while studying, but I expressed my uncontrollable feelings by filling my practice notebook with hearts.

Then came Pepero Day, an annual event for teenagers. I had been exchanging messages with Chan little by little and feeling a connection stronger than before. So, of course, I couldn't miss that day. Conveying my feelings is only hard the first time; the second time was too easy.

Again, I sent a text to Junseok during lunchtime: 'URGENT MEETING NEEDED!!'. We met in the hallway in front of my Class 2.

"Just come to our class and give it to Chan yourself! You gave him a tangerine, what's the big deal?"
"I don't want to be *that* obvious, though."
"Hmm... then how about this?"

Junseok's suggested plan was as follows: Since Junseok and Chan eat lunch together, he would hang out with Chan after lunch. While doing that, he would suggest they take a walk in the hallway to digest, and I would pretend to accidentally run into them. However, giving it only to Chan might be too obvious, so I should give Pepero to Junseok as well.

It sounded like a good plan, so we decided to execute it the next day. Holding two packs of Almond Pepero I had bought at the convenience store the day before, I waited by the back door of my classroom for Junseok's signal. I looked into the mirror next to the back door, constantly adjusting my bangs with a small comb. I wondered if I could really do it. Last time, I was too shy to look at Chan's face and just threw the tangerine and ran away... I carefully held the Pepero wrapper in my hand, worried that my nervous grip would crush it.

Would this Pepero be able to show Chan my feelings again?

'Min Hyojung, we're about to turn the corner by Class 1. Come out now.'

These two packs of Pepero were a luxury for me, as my weekly allowance was 30,000 KRW. But I think the reason I bought that much was because I had courage. I didn't feel it was a waste when I paid for the Pepero. I only hoped that Chan would enjoy eating my Pepero. Giving Pepero to the person I like on Pepero Day... I felt like I was the female lead in a webtoon. With a pounding, fluttering heart, I cheered myself on.

*Come on, Hyojung, you can do this. You have to at least be able to look at Chan's face and give him something delicious before graduation.* I kept taking deep breaths.

*Drrrk*-, I opened the door and stepped out. I saw the hoodie Chan often wore in the distance. I almost ran away out of habit. We had supposedly become closer in the digital space by exchanging messages, but I still didn't have the confidence to talk to him face-to-face. I always avoided situations where I might run into Chan. However, communicating with him only made my crush grow stronger. Even seeing just his silhouette from this distance, I felt like he must look handsome again today.

My heart pounded as if the words 'thump, thump' were written around my head. I couldn't bring myself to walk while looking at Chan's face, so I walked towards him, looking only at the zipper of his hoodie. Then, I awkwardly blurted out,

"Oh. Hi. Here, eat this- A-and this is for Junseok, too."

I stammered. Embarrassed, I bowed my head, then slightly looked up at Chan's face. It was the first time in almost a year I had seen Chan's face up close. He still had pale, clear skin, was tall enough that I had to look up at him, and had the straight hair that swayed when he played basketball. The round glasses he sometimes wore added to his cuteness. It was as if Chan was rewriting my ideal type.

His looks were the kind I felt I would never get tired of, even seeing them every day. Chan looked at my Pepero with a slightly surprised expression,

"Tha-thanks-"

*Right, I was giving Chan Pepero*. I had been practically admiring Chan's face after a long time, and startled by his voice, I realized where I was and my face flushed. I was too embarrassed to hear the rest of what Chan was saying, so I ran into the back door of Class 1.

I tried to act as if nothing was wrong, but if anyone had been close to me, they might have heard my heart pounding. I approached my friend Chaeyoung in Class 1, pretending I had something to ask her. But as expected, Chaeyoung said to me,

"Hyojung, why is your face so red?!"

---

'Ting-'

While I was studying after dinner, a text message came from Junseok, saying he had amazing news to tell me.

'Do you know what Chan said after you almost ran away into Class 1? He said, *Min Hyojung thought she was only giving it to me and looked so happy.*'

At first, I thought I had misread it. Did Chan really say that? Really? I couldn't believe it. Since Junseok started talking in a flustered way, I thought it was just his usual fuss. That's why the statement came as an even greater surprise. Again, I covered my mouth with my hand and jumped up, bouncing around, just like when I received the first text from Chan.

It felt like my true feelings had strongly reached Chan. Beyond reaching him, I even imagined happily that maybe Chan had also opened his heart. I don't know if I dare use this expression, but my giving him the Pepero seemed to have been a heart-fluttering action for Chan too.

I wasn't without worries. I worried that Chan might feel burdened by my small gifts. Honestly, if a boy I didn't particularly like were to shower me with snacks, I would have been disgusted. But at least Chan didn't seem upset. Instead, he was happy about my gift! I would have been happy just knowing Chan ate the Pepero I gave him deliciously, but he even said something like that.

I was proud that I had become someone who could gather the courage for the person I liked. And I was happy that there was someone who responded to my courage. I liked Chan even more.

After that, before we knew it, it was mid-December. We had spent time preparing for the high schools we wanted, feeling nervous and anxious. I tasted the moment of acceptance and received congratulations from friends and parents. For the past three years, I had made three wishes every night before bed while looking at the moon: First, always keep the people around me happy. Second, help me wisely overcome any difficulties I face. Third, let me attend the foreign language high school.

I had poured so much time and effort into going to that high school that, given the result of my efforts before my eyes, I honestly couldn't focus on anything other than that result, rather than Chan. To ensure my efforts were not in vain, I practically lived at the academy so I could adapt well to high school.

It was the same for Chan. Of course, my feelings for Chan hadn't disappeared. Whenever I stopped by the convenience store with friends on the way home, all I could think about was Chan when I saw delicious snacks. So, even during the busy period for both of us, I secretly went to Chan's shoe locker or classroom locker and left snacks, as if I were his *manitto*.

Every time, Chan would always text me to thank me and say he enjoyed the snack. I quietly maintained my love, feeding on those small bits of happiness. Unaware of the chilling weather, I watched Chan play basketball every lunchtime. I smiled when I saw Chan wave his hand at me sometimes.

Even during winter break, our respective schedules only got busier instead of easing up. Advanced class, special math class, special Korean class, mock exam review class... Honestly, the desire to go to the foreign language high school was entirely my own hope, with absolutely no pressure from my parents. So, having to juggle this many academy schedules was purely my own choice. I couldn't blame myself for not quickly replying to Chan's occasional texts like 'What are you doing?' because I was too busy studying.

Honestly, sometimes Chan's texts felt burdensome and resentful. It was inevitable that Chan would find out about my precious, innocent crush, but Chan revealed too much that he knew the fact. The problem was that I would still stomp my feet happily at those very points. I desperately wanted to tell him my feelings, yet I desperately wanted to hide them. I sometimes messed up my hair in confusion over the subtle feelings, but ultimately, I would find myself thinking about Chan. It seemed I had developed an even greater fantasy about Chan, whom I hadn't met once during the whole winter break.

When winter break ended and I went to the auditorium for the commencement ceremony, I could only see Chan in the Class 6 line in the distance. His straight posture, neatly combed hair, pale face, round glasses that suited his cute face. Chan had become the perfect epitome of my ideal type at some point. He saw me, smiled widely, and with his unique vibrant energy, raised his hand high to wave and greet me.

My heart pounded again, just like the moment I realized I liked Chan. Embarrassed again, I quickly turned my head away as if I hadn't seen Chan and spoke to the friend next to me. *Min Hyojung, how long are you going to keep doing this?*

We only had two weeks of school after the commencement ceremony until graduation. That meant I only had two weeks left to see Chan. Watching Chan play basketball with his friends, his bangs swaying as he leaned on the window during every lunchtime, secretly putting small snacks in his locker, imagining him eating them deliciously, running away with a flushed face if we accidentally ran into each other in the hallway—all of that would end in two weeks.

My middle school years were certainly not filled only with Chan. There were friends who created memories that made us laugh until our stomachs hurt over the past three years, friends with whom I shared countless memories since elementary school entrance ceremonies in the same neighborhood, teachers who kindly counseled me through the worries of my sensitive adolescence, and seniors I met in the drawing club. The thought of leaving all of this behind and making a new start in a different area made something squirm inside my heart. I still don't know what that subtle emotion was—it wasn't sadness, excitement, or nervousness.

That churning feeling lasted for the entire two weeks. The school was hectic during the two weeks leading up to graduation. There was so much to write every day as we had to summarize our student records from the past three years. In addition, since we only had a few days left to see each other naturally in the same classroom or on the same floor of the building, I spent a lot of time with friends to make final memories.

A few days before graduation, I requested a final consultation with Junseok.

"This is really the last time, I guess. Thank you so, so much for everything. It must have been annoying to listen to my trivial worries".
"Min Hyojung, you talk like you're going far away. So, you're worried about what to do at the graduation ceremony, right?"
"Yeah. One last time... I want to let Chan know one last time that there was a person named Min Hyojung who liked him".

We talked and worried together for a long time. Fortunately, since it was graduation season, even the homeroom teacher didn't check if all the students were in the classroom during class. About an hour later, we said together,

"Yes, that's perfect!"

---

7 AM. This alarm clock that had rung the same way for three years. I always woke up cursing under my breath, but graduation day must be special. I found myself feeling sad that I wouldn't hear this alarm anymore. With a subtle emotion, I prepared for my last walk to school. I absolutely couldn't forget the gift I had prepared the day before for Chan.

The 15-minute walk I took every morning felt new. After three years, I had even memorized exactly when the traffic light at the intersection changed. Crossing the light that changed at 8:11 AM, passing the post office, and then, around the time I could see the sign for our neighborhood park, I could see the students gathering at our middle school. Now, it was truly goodbye. Seeing the banner that read 'OO Middle School Graduation Ceremony' made it feel more real.

I went into the main auditorium where the graduation ceremony was held and sat next to Seoyeon, a classmate I was closest to in the 9th grade.

"Kya, I can't believe it! Graduation!"
"I know! Kyaa!"

In this situation that could have been sad, we chatted, making an even greater fuss. We talked about past memories and shared our expectations for high school life. Of course, I also kept glancing around to find Chan.

Finally, the graduation ceremony began. As a result of our efforts over the past three years, six students, including Chan and me, received the Academic Excellence Award. I felt really good that my three years of hard work hadn't been in vain, and I was happy that Chan was also being rewarded for his efforts. The award recipients from each class came out and waited below the platform to have their names called. As expected, Chan spoke to me.

"Congratulations, Hyojung. I guess we really studied hard, huh?"
"Y-yeah, I guess so. Congratulations to you too. Good job".

Chan smiled brightly and went up to the platform first. How could he look so cool even while receiving an award? The time I had left to see that bright smile: one hour.

After the awards, all 300 students were presented with their graduation certificates. Looking at the certificate, the thought of actually graduating sank in. *My middle school life is really over*. The graduation music playing in the background somehow made me tear up. Following that was the photo time—my last chance to convey my feelings to Chan.

After quickly taking pictures with my classmates, I looked around to find Chan. But it wasn't easy to find him right away, with so many people taking pictures everywhere. I thought I should go to a higher place to find him faster, so I walked towards the platform. At that moment, I made eye contact with Chan, who was trying to climb onto the platform from the opposite side. I felt like time had stopped for a moment.

Maybe it was because it was graduation, or maybe I was crazy. I was walking straight towards Chan, looking right into his eyes. I didn't know that the meaning of 'last' could give me so much courage. The phrase "getting into the spirit" must exist for a reason. Chan walked towards me, smiling. *You look so pretty when you smile, Chan*.

"Congratulations on your graduation, Hyojung".
"Congratulations on your graduation, Chan".

Suddenly, I wanted to stare at Chan without thinking, so I looked at him without avoiding his eyes. But that was only for a moment. After three seconds, I felt my face turning red, so I quickly bowed my head slightly, letting my long hair cover my cheeks. I resented myself for having a red face even at the very end. I felt like Chan would only remember me as the girl with red cheeks. I didn't want that.

But it was truly, truly the last time. If I bowed my head again because of my shyness, I felt I would regret it forever.

Firmly resolving myself, I took out my final gift from my pocket.

"Chan, here's a graduation gift".

Boldly, openly, I showed my feelings to Chan for the first time. I gave him the gift I had prepared just for him, looking only at Chan without avoiding his gaze. Chan opened the small box and, with a big eye-smile, said to me,

"This is the first gift you've given me directly. Thank you so much".

That's right. The gift Junseok and I decided on was a tangerine. I stacked the tangerines neatly in a small box. Since it was the first time I'd gathered the courage to let Chan know my feelings existed, I wanted to give him that same pure feeling as my final gift.

"Hyojung, actually, I prepared a graduation gift for you too. That's why I was coming up to the platform—to find you".

Chan pulled three chocolate bars tied with a ribbon out of his coat pocket and offered them to me.

"You put chocolate bars in my locker so often. Those chocolate bars really helped me when I was struggling while studying. I hope you eat these chocolate bars too, and finish preparing for high school well during the remaining time!"

*This is what Chan's voice sounds like, right.* Since starting my crush, I was too shy, so we mostly talked through text. I simply couldn't have a face-to-face conversation with Chan. *My heart can pound this much just by looking at the person I like and listening to them talk*.

I felt like if I said *thank you* to Chan, my overwhelming excitement would be revealed. Looking into Chan's eyes, I nodded, using that as my thank you.

"Chan, should we take a picture?"

We took a picture together with my phone. It was amazing to be together in the screen, and I was overwhelmed that something featuring both of us would exist in the world.

Hearing Seunghee, a friend I've been with since elementary school, calling me from a distance, I reluctantly said my final goodbye to Chan.

"Congratulations on your graduation again. Good luck with high school too, and take care".

Honestly, my face had been red for a while, but I didn't want to show my flushed face until the very end. I quickly bowed my head and, only slightly hearing Chan's reply, ran to my friend. My friend hugged me tightly and cried in my arms, saying she would miss me so much since I would be going to school in a different area. Since many friends were looking for me to say their goodbyes, the graduation ceremony ended in a rush without me seeing Chan one last time.

I had dinner with my family after the graduation ceremony. I was so excited during the meal that I don't even remember the taste of the expensive food we ate. As expected, social media was buzzing that night. People were sharing graduation photos and talking about how thankful they were for the past three years. I also couldn't put down my phone for a long time, chatting with friends, sitting leaning against my closet, my favorite spot in my room.

Close friends, friends I wasn't close to but had grown fond of, friends who were almost like family... regardless of who they were, we exchanged words of thanks and wished each other well for their hard work. That emotion that had existed fuzzily in my heart for two weeks began to feel like boiling water. I felt like I was going to cry. We weren't breaking up forever, it wasn't a life-long separation. In the IT world of today, we could communicate in real-time even with people on the other side of the globe, so what was the big deal about graduation?

But the feeling didn't subside, so I kept flipping through the same graduation photos. Then, I came across the picture of Chan and me.

'*I won't be able to see him anymore*'.

I tried to act cool, flipping past the picture to look at photos with other friends. Then, suddenly curious about the SNS post I had uploaded about an hour ago, I went back to SNS. As I scrolled through the comments, my finger stopped at one comment.

'Congrats on your graduation, Hyojung!! It was fun being in the same class in 2nd grade, and thank you so much for the 3rd grade. Let's do well in high school! :)'

I read that short message over and over for a long time. Then, *Hulk*, the uncontrollable emotion made my heart sink. I don't know why I cried. Was it because I wouldn't see Chan anymore? Was it because Chan didn't say he liked me? I had absolutely no intention of dating Chan, so those couldn't be the reasons. But I felt like I would burst if I didn't cry now.

After crying quietly for a while, I focused on the lingering, unidentified emotion. What was this emotion, and why was it still sitting in my heart even after shedding tears? What was certain was that this emotion existed because of Chan. To find the answer, I recalled my actions during my crush on Chan one by one.

The memories of giving him delicious snacks came up the most, followed by staring at Chan playing basketball during lunchtime. Accidentally running into him in the hallway, and purposely turning around to hide my flushed face and run away from the path I was walking on. Whenever there was an all-school event, tiptoeing to look around Class 6 to find Chan. And, a few hours ago at the graduation ceremony, bowing my head and turning away as if running away from Chan, even at the very end. *Why are all my memories of running away?*

I thought I had conveyed my feelings to Chan, but was it really *conveyed*? When this thought crossed my mind, I finally realized what I had to do. I had to confess, confess my feelings.

The next day, I had lunch with Seunghee because we had plans to study at the library. After ordering the lunch menu, I spoke to Seunghee.

"I think I'm going to confess to Chan after all".
"What?! You said you didn't want to date Chan!"
"I'm not confessing to ask him out, just a text saying I *liked* him. I already wrote it in my memo app last night. But I just can't bring myself to press the send button yet. I'm so nervous because it's my first confession".
"Let me read it".

Seunghee took my phone and seemed to read what I had written thoroughly.

"You wrote it well~ Now all you have to do is wait for the reply".

I didn't understand Seunghee's words at first, but the time we had spent together over the past few years made me realize what Seunghee had done. Seunghee, the action-oriented friend with a fiery personality, knew that shy me would never send the text on my own courage.

I opened the messaging app, and sure enough, the message had already been sent.

[Chan, you probably knew this, but I liked you a lot for the past few months. I was really happy during the time I liked you. Thank you for giving me happy memories to take with me. Take care in high school]

"Hey!"
"I know you wouldn't send it by yourself anyway. Just be grateful to your big sister here".

As Seunghee said, I probably wouldn't have pressed the send button in the end if it weren't for her. I was secretly grateful.

But after I realized the message had been sent, I couldn't concentrate on anything else. Imagining Chan reading my message, I suddenly felt embarrassed and buried my head in my book, then got nervous and shook my leg, and then surfed the internet to try and think about something else. Since I couldn't predict his reaction at all, my mind was scattered and hazy.

In that moment of spending two unproductive hours, a notification popped up on my phone screen. I couldn't breathe for about five seconds. I wondered if my heart could pound so loudly in my ears. I truly didn't have the courage to read it. *What if he insults me?* *What if Chan was actually burdened by everything I did for him?*

I imagined all sorts of negative scenarios in my head before receiving the unexpected hurt. *This will conclude my one-sided love*. *This will determine what emotions I feel when I look back on the story of my last few months, years from now*. Thinking these thoughts made me even more unable to open Chan's message.

However, my curiosity about Chan's reply seemed greater than my worries. After agonizing, I took a slight deep breath and finally read the two messages that came from Chan.

[Thank you for liking me all this time]
[And I'm sorry, for not being able to do as much for you as you did for me]

I felt like time stopped for a moment. The small noises in the library, my friend's breathing, even the sound of my own heart seemed to stop for a moment. Then, tears burst forth. Unlike the tears I shed last night, these were tears pouring out as if spitting out the remaining emotional lump. I bolted out of the reading room and ran to the bathroom. I heard Seunghee running after me.

"Hyojung, you did well. Truly, all this time".

I cried for a long time, held in Seunghee's arms.

---

Until we had to go home for dinner, Seunghee and I talked about the past few months on the library rooftop garden. More accurately, I recounted my actions over the past few months and the feelings I felt while doing them, as if organizing them. *I really worked hard, I did*. On my studies, and on expressing my love.

"You know I watched everything you did, Hyojung? And I really wondered if a person could like someone that much. You're really amazing. I hope I can passionately like someone like you someday".

I felt tears welling up again. The actions of this one-sided love, which might seem insignificant to some, could be something someone else would want to experience someday. Thinking about it, I really liked Chan a lot. It felt like he was the only one shining even in the auditorium filled with all the students. It felt like Chan's smile had a scent. Thinking of Chan made me happy, yet my heart felt a little ache.

Walking home, I looked up at the sky and saw a pink sunset.

"Wow, it's beautiful".

That single sentence just escaped my lips. I walked for a long time, looking at the sunset, until I came face-to-face with our middle school. The beautiful sky, and my middle school where I had poured so many beautiful feelings. With the converging emotions, I paused and fully absorbed the scenery I wouldn't see again and the feelings born from that scenery.

I felt a heart-warming memory settle in my heart. And the last rays of sunlight shining brightly in the distance gave me confirmation. Chan was my first love. That I first felt the emotion of love and learned how to purely show my feelings. Someone said that the feeling of love can't be mistaken, and it seems true. Sixteen-year-old me knew love.

That pure white color, where I first felt love and didn't know what to do, so I expressed my feelings with small snacks, became another color in my life. I learned how to love a person and how to express that love. *Thank you for letting me, the me of that time, like the you of that time*.
