Where Do the Seagulls Go

One step toward the island,
One step of loneliness.
At one sound of the boat whistle far away,
The small island village before me
Echoes.

The colorful signs
Have somehow faded
And only the dry sound of the seagulls fills their empty color.

I walk the coast
The sand clings to my ankles as if pleading,
But as it moves away from the sea, the dried grains of sand
Powerlessly *thump*, fly away.

Seagulls above my head
The most joyful seagulls on this island
One, two, dozens of them
They all must have a place to go

Friends of the sea
Is there a reason for your great joy
If that reason is a predetermined destination,

I walk the blue sea again,
Similar to the blue sky they are singing to

With the companions of the island
I walk the sea
And together
I listened to the sea

Perhaps their confident voice
Is the sound of a postman bringing news of a bold future
Saying it's not over yet
To hurry and wake up to see that clear blue

At the seagulls' urging sound,
The island, thanks to them, is not peaceful today.
